# Git Workshop

This repo is meant to support [my presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cc5GxL9xJPmV5BQ2e5hGn61r1kIjfwTPpVF0GwUROjs/edit?usp=sharing). It's meant to be an interactive way to teach the most commonly used git commands I use day-to-day. I have more details in [my blog post]() as well.
